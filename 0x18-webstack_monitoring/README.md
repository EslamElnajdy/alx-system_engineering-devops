# 0x18-webstack_monitoring

## Background

Because we believe in this saying `You can't fix or improve what you cannot measure` we realise that monitoring how our Software systems are doing  is important thing.

In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is goning on our servers.

web stack monitoring can broken down into 2 categories:
 - Application monitoring: getting data about your runing software and making sure it is behaving as expected
 - Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded(could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
